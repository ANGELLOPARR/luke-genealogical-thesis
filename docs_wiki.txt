Chan was born on 7 April 1954 in Hong Kong as Chan Kong-sang (Chinese: 陳港生; lit. 'born in Hong Kong'[23]) to Charles and Lee-Lee Chan, refugees from the Chinese Civil War. His parents were so poor they had to borrow money from friends to pay the doctor.[23] His parents nicknamed him Pao-pao (Chinese: 炮炮; lit. 'Cannonball') because the energetic child was always rolling around.[24] His parents worked for the French ambassador in Hong Kong, and Chan spent his formative years within the grounds of the consul's residence in the Victoria Peak district.[25]

In 1982, Chan married Joan Lin, a Taiwanese actress. Their son, singer and actor Jaycee Chan, was born that same year.[68] Chan's extra-marital affair with Elaine Ng Yi-Lei produced a daughter by the name of Etta Ng Chok Lam, born on 18 January 1999. It turned into a scandal within the media. Although he reportedly gave Elaine 70,000 HK dollars each month for her living expenses and 600,000 HK dollars when she moved to Shanghai, the transactions were later claimed to be nonexistent by her lawyer.[107][108][109][110] Despite regretting the results of the affair, Chan said he had "only committed a fault that many men in the world commit".[111][112][113] During the incident, Elaine stated she would take care of her daughter without Chan.[114]
